During summer 2016 I spent two months in Macedonia, city of Ohrid. My top places to visit in Macedonia:
##1. Ohrid
MacedoniaÂ´s most turistic place, with its beautiful 365 churches (one for every day) and one of the cleanest lakes in Europe.
###1. Monastery of Saint Naum
Have to see, the best type of transport is by the lake on a boat.
###1. Plaosnik hill
The church of St. Clement and St. Panteleimon is beautiful, but event more breathtaking is the view, when you are standing next to St.Kaneo church.
##1. Galicica national park
It is situated between the two biggest lakes in the republic: Lake Ohrid and Lake Prespa. From few places on the top you can see both lakes at once.
##1. Skopje
###1. Old bazaar
Cheap turkish food, drinks and stock.
###1. Canyon Matka
Meaning "womb" and one of the most popular outdoor destinations.
