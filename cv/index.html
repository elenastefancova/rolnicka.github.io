    User Experience is one of the most important criteria for designing user interfaces and testing their usability, with emotions as its essential element - how a user feels during interaction with an application. In our work, we measure their value and explore how they are influenced by noticeable mistakes of usability. In this work, two approaches are used: electroencephalography (EEG) and facial expression recognition. We use EEG device EMOTIV Epoc and for facial expression recognition we apply Noldus FaceReader software. We propose a method of classification of emotional changes from data obtained by this approach that employs also machine learning. To evaluate this method, we plan to carry out an experiment with an application, the interface of which includes intentionally inserted usability issues, and with which the users will work during the experiment. We expect this experiment to expose, what emotional response of the user could be caused by the usability issues.
